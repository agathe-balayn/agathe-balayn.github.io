I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the <a href="#https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/">Web Information Systems group</a> (WIS) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, at Delft University of Technology.

My research is focused on uncovering and understanding some of the harms that the deployment of machine learning systems into society can raise. 
The harms that I study are related to issues of biases in the outputs of the systems, potentially resulting in safety hazards or discrimination and unfairness.
While I'm interested in any kind of machine learning systems, my research primarily focuses on the ones using image data --machine learning based computer vision-- (or sometimes tabular data) to perform classification or regression tasks. 

In my research, I aim at making contributions of varying nature. I develop algorithmic methods --and in some cases UIs to make them more usable in practice-- to facilitate the identification of the potential harms of developed systems before they occur, and structured frameworks to foster a systematic reflection about these harms during the development of the systems. Besides, I also study how developers of such systems perceive the harms and their roles in reinforcing or mitigating these.

My promotors are Alessandro Bozzon and Geert-Jan Houben, and my co-promotor is Christoph Lofi. I also work in close collaboration with Jie Yang and Seda Guerses on these topics. 

Prior to that, I had the opportunity to work on other machine learning -related topics pertaining to the automatic detection of hate speech, the automatic translation of Japanese sign language to Japanese, and to the human-guided control of a robotic arm.

I hold an MSc degree in Computer Science from the <a href=www.tudelft.nl>TU Delft</a>, the Netherlands, and an engineering diploma (with its MSc degree equivalence) in Systems and Control from the <a href="https://www.ensta-paris.fr/en">ENSTA ParisTech</a>, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France.
